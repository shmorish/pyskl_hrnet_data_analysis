# PYSKL data format

PYSKL now provides pre-processed pickle annotations files for training and testing. The pre-processing scripts will be released in later updates. Below we demonstrate the format of the annotation files and provide the download links.

## The format of the pickle files

Each pickle file corresponds to an action recognition dataset. The content of a pickle file is a dictionary with two fields: `split` and `annotations`

1. Split: The value of the `split` field is a dictionary: the keys are the split names, while the values are lists of video identifiers that belong to the specific clip.
2. Annotations: The value of the `annotations` field is a list of skeleton annotations, each skeleton annotation is a dictionary, containing the following fields:
   1. `frame_dir` (str): The identifier of the corresponding video.
   2. `total_frames` (int): The number of frames in this video.
   3. `img_shape` (tuple[int]): The shape of a video frame, a tuple with two elements, in the format of (height, width). Only required for 2D skeletons.
   4. `original_shape` (tuple[int]): Same as `img_shape`.
   5. `label` (int): The action label.
   6. `keypoint` (np.ndarray, with shape [M x T x V x C]): The keypoint annotation. M: number of persons; T: number of frames (same as `total_frames`); V: number of keypoints (25 for NTURGB+D 3D skeleton, 17 for CoCo, 18 for OpenPose, etc. ); C: number of dimensions for keypoint coordinates (C=2 for 2D keypoint, C=3 for 3D keypoint).
   7. `keypoint_score` (np.ndarray, with shape [M x T x V]): The confidence score of keypoints. Only required for 2D skeletons.
